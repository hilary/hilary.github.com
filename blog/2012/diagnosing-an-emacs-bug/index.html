<h2 id="problem">problem</h2>

<p>My Shell Switcher mode Customize settings stopped persisting across
emacs sessions. I’ve used Shell Switcher for a long time without any
problems, then *poof*, the Customize settings stopped working. The
Shell Switcher related key bindings</p>

<pre><code>(global-set-key (kbd "C-'") 'shell-switcher-switch-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x 4 '") 'shell-switcher-switch-buffer-other-window)
</code></pre>

<p>I set outside of Customize in <code>.emacs</code> persisted across sessions, but
the Shell Switcher settings</p>

<pre><code>'(shell-switcher-mode t)
'(shell-switcher-new-shell-function (quote shell-switcher-make-shell))
</code></pre>

<p>set through Customize did not. Once I used the Customize interface to set 
the settings during a session they would stay set, however, when I quit
emacs and restarted later, the settings were no longer effective.</p>

<p>The Shell Switcher <em>entries</em> in Customize’s <code>custom-set-variables</code> in
<code>.emacs</code> were still present (and had not changed from when they had been
effective), they just did not control Shell Switcher’s behavior.</p>

<p>My install: GNU Emacs 24.1.50.2 (i386-apple-darwin11.4.0, NS
apple-appkit-1138.47) of 2012-05-15.</p>

<h2 id="symptoms">symptoms</h2>

<p>In a new emacs setting, <code>C-'</code> (switch buffer) triggered Shell Switcher:</p>

<pre><code>No active shell buffer, create new one? (y or n)
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good, that’s one of the key bindings I set in <code>.emacs</code>. But
when I responded <code>y</code>, I could see Shell Switcher loading (it should
already have done that when I started emacs).</p>

<p>Far more blatant, though, was that the buffer it launched was running 
the wrong shell: it came up in emacs shell.</p>

<p>Unlike <code>custom-set-variables</code> in <code>.emacs</code>, <code>Customize Apropos</code>
shell-switcher displayed the values for the two settings that matched
their behavior in a new emacs session:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">setting</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code>shell-switcher-mode</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code>nil</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code>shell-switcher-new-shell-function</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left"><code>shell-switcher-make-eshell</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Stranger still, both settings had <code>State: CHANGED outside Customize</code></p>

<p>If I used Customize to set the values they would take and stay set
for that session. When next I launched emacs, however, they were
gone.</p>

<h2 id="hunt-and-gather">hunt and gather</h2>

<p><em>skip this section if you aren’t into software journaling</em></p>

<p>When this happened I was mystified. I discovered something was wrong
when hitting <code>C-'</code> one day produced a buffer running the wrong shell.
I was deep in the midst of coding and wasn’t going to drop everything
in order to diagnose a different problem: I reset the setting, made a
note of what had happened and got back to work.</p>

<p>Several days later, when I got my first chance to look at what was 
wrong, I could not identify any change in my emacs configuration that
might have caused the problem. I had not made any recent changes
except that I had started using the built-in irc client, erc. Nothing
unusual showed up in the Messages buffer. Running emacs with the 
debug switch didn’t shed any light.</p>

<p>The <code>CHANGED outside Customize</code> thing really threw me. Was one of the
other packages, perhaps one that was a major mode, meddling with Shell
Switcher, which is, after all, a minor mode? I dug around the emacs
world for insight (emacswiki and friends), looked on
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stack</a>, consulted the great oracle
of Google. I couldn’t find anything (usually I can at least find
something that shakes my thinking loose so I can solve the problem).</p>

<p>In the end I wrote my first
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12536790/emacs-shell-switcher-customizations-being-overridden">question</a>
on stack. When I didn’t get any answers to my question after
a day or so, I followed their advice and posted a link to it to
my Facebook feed. The discussion that followed was helpful in
that it validated that the solution was not obvious, lol.</p>

<p>I had projects that took priority. Time passed. I earned my
fourth stack badge: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/badges/63/tumbleweed">tumbleweed</a>.</p>

<h2 id="diagnosis">diagnosis</h2>

<h3 id="approach">approach</h3>

<p>When I finally made a few hours to tackle the problem, I used
an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/james_whittaker/">internal fault model</a>.</p>

<p>I developed an initial question and sketched out a plan based on 
possible outcomes. The ideal question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is testable without undue work;</li>
  <li>directly addresses the problem;</li>
  <li>has seperable, easy to detect, concrete outcomes;</li>
  <li>and moves the solution forwards regardless of outcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t require questions to have yes or no answers; it’s more
valuable to have a question that reflects the underlying information
architecture.  The sketch of the plan addresses any difficulties with
not having yes/no answers, as it clearly identifies what each of the
outcomes mean. The sketch is a sketch because it makes no sense to
have some abstract, methodological requirement that an engineer expend
resources fleshing out many branches when only one will be
realized. That’s what judgment is for, and methodology should support
judgment, not hamper it.</p>

<p>A second realm in which the engineer’s judgment is critical comes in
weighing the relative importance of the listed criteria in context. As
we don’t function in an ideal world, we often have to trade-off one
criteria with other(s). Note that context is wildly situational, as an
engineer makes progress diagnosing a problem the relative importance
of the criteria may change, even in the same problem. Perhaps the
easiest case to see is when, upon initial exploration, what appeared
to be a minor annoyance turns out to be a symptom of a deep-seated
problem. At that point, the definition of ‘undue’ shifts.</p>

<h3 id="question">question</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do Shell Switcher mode customizations persist across emacs sessions
if there are no changes made outside <code>custom-set-variables</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="plan-sketch">plan (sketch)</h3>

<p>Possible outcomes and associated next steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Neither customization persists.</p>

    <p>This outcome would indicate:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>that whatever was causing the setting to be rewritten was less
to be a result of some other package interfering with the Shell
Switcher mode settings</li>
      <li>a bug in customize (the <code>CHANGED outside Customize</code> flag setting)
As I was sketching out the plan, I remembered an answer I had seen
on stack to a question concerning in Customize; the
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10042639/what-does-saved-and-set-mismatch-and-in-particular-the-mismatch-part-me">answer</a>
had identified a bug in Customize associated with the same flag. I
went digging for the question, while it did not shed light
directly on my problem, it certainly helped with the fault model!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the case of this outcome, I could see two routes to follow:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Comment out all entries in <code>custom-set-variables</code> except for
the Shell Switcher entries to check for packages affecting 
Shell Switcher programmatically, after all, if this path
proved true I was also looking at two bugs.</li>
      <li>Move <em>all</em> the Shell Switcher configuration outside of Customize
in my <code>.emacs</code> and see if it persisted across sessions. If
so, at the least I would have a viable workaround. Less
diagnostic value than the previous step, though.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both customizations persist.</p>

    <p>The inverse case; this outcome would suggest that something in
my <code>.emacs</code> customizations was causing the problem.</p>

    <p>In this case, I would look for candidates to reintroduce that might
be responsible. If all else failed, I could binary search my way through
the list to find the culprit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intermediate cases: Shell Switcher mode stays enabled but the
buffer is launched in the wrong shell, or the buffer launches in the
right shell but Shell Switcher mode is disabled.</p>

    <p>Neither case seemed either remotely likely. With not one, but two
cases that fit my fault model, I decided not to put resources towards
researching potential causes and paths for the intermediate cases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="action">action</h3>

<p>As I organized my <code>.emacs</code> into separate files by topic long ago, I
could turn off customizations outside of <code>custom-set-variables</code> 
by commenting out a few <code>load</code> statements:</p>

<pre><code>; (load "~/.emacs.d/hilz_config/tramp.el")
; (load "~/.emacs.d/hilz_config/ruby_extensions.el")
; (load "~/.emacs.d/hilz_config/shell_switcher.el")
; (load "~/.emacs.d/hilz_config/personalize.el")
</code></pre>

<p>Then I used the Customize interface to</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable Shell Switcher mode</li>
  <li>set <code>shell-switcher-new-shell-function</code> to <code>shell-switcher-make-shell</code></li>
</ul>

<p>and hit <code>Apply and Save</code>. I opened <code>.emacs</code> and verified the presence of</p>

<pre><code>'(shell-switcher-mode t)
'(shell-switcher-new-shell-function (quote shell-switcher-make-shell))
</code></pre>

<p>towards the end of the <code>custom-set-variables</code> entry. I restarted emacs.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">outcome</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, the customizations were lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I no longer was defining the key bindings, I now had to use <code>M-x
shell-switcher-new-shell</code> to test Shell Switcher.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  When I did, the
behavior I observed was the same as before: Shell Switcher loaded when
I used the command and the buffer came up in the wrong shell.</p>

<p>I looked in <code>.emacs</code>. The entries were still present in
<code>custom-set-variables</code>. I invoked Customize and saw what I’ve been
seeing all along:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the values for the Shell Switcher variables did not match the values
set in the <code>custom-set-variables</code> entry</li>
  <li>the Shell Switcher variables were shown as being in state <code>CHANGED
outside Customize</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>No change.</p>

<h3 id="drill-down">drill down</h3>

<p>As the question appeared to me to have more diagnostic value, I started with</p>

<h4 id="question-1">question</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do Shell Switcher mode customizations persist across emacs sessions
if no other customizations are made in <code>.emacs</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="plan">plan</h4>

<p>Whichever outcome I got, I intended to move on to my second question from my
original plan next, as I needed a workaround and had spent quite a bit of time
on the issue that day by then (I kept notes, which I later expanded to this
post). If the Shell Switcher mode customizations persisted across emacs 
sessions when all the other customizations were commented out, then I would
return at a later date and tackle the issue as I would have had one of my
own customizations proven responsible.</p>

<h4 id="action-1">action</h4>

<p>I commented out everything under <code>custom-set-variables</code> other than the
Shell Switcher mode settings. Even the basic options: inhibiting the
startup screen, the initial scratch message and the like.</p>

<p>This is the first time I have encountered a project that might justify
setting up a full development environment for emacs. Were I not in the
middle of job interviews, I would have been tempted to take the time to
build one so that I could approach this issue as I would a ruby project.
I’ve looked at the tools for emacs before, but lack the community to
work with that is such a critical part of accelerating learning. Gah.</p>

<h4 id="outcome-1">outcome</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>No</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok. Is this a bug in Customize that runs deeper than a cosmetic issue
(displaying the wrong flag setting)? Or is there something wrong with 
Shell Switcher? Or, of course, an interaction between the two…</p>

<p>On to the next step of my plan, and hopefully a workaround.</p>

<h4 id="question-2">question</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do Shell Switcher mode settings set outside of Customize persist
across sessions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By that I mean do I encounter the same problem if I use</p>

<pre><code>(setq shell-switcher-mode t)
(setq shell-switcher-new-shell-function 'shell-switcher-make-shell)
</code></pre>

<p>instead of the Customize interface. Given the results I had seen so
far, I rather expected the settings to persist.</p>

<h4 id="plan-1">plan</h4>

<p>If the settings did not persist, it would suggest a problem with Shell
Switcher mode. (My first step when the settings stopped persisting had
been to read the code for the mode, but nothing had jumped out at me.)</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the settings did not persist, it would suggest
that the problem rested with customize. Shell Switcher is a minor mode
that behaves somewhat differently from most minor modes, it isn’t really
surprising that it might break more easily.</p>

<h4 id="action-2">action</h4>

<p>I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>re-enabled my other customizations in <code>custom-set-variables</code> so that
emacs was not ghastly to work in</li>
  <li>took the Shell Switcher lines out of <code>custom-set-variables</code></li>
  <li>added the <code>setq</code> lines listed in the previous section to <code>.emacs</code>
after <code>custom-set-variables</code></li>
  <li>restarted emacs.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="outcome-2">outcome</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. Shell Switcher settings persist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahah! A workaround! And lots of info for the customize folks. Seems
awfully likley that this problem is another symptom of an underlying
defect that caused the issue discussed in the stack question I had
noticed, despite the differences between the two. Or perhaps not: the
other user’s settings did persist.</p>

<h2 id="bug-report">bug report</h2>

<p>I’ve never done this before. Ah well, nothing ventured…</p>

<pre><code>M-x report-emacs-bug

Bug Subject: Customize is borked!
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmmm…. maybe not.</p>

<pre><code>Bug Subject: Shell Switcher mode customization not persisted across sessions
</code></pre>

<p>Phew! I’m in a buffer with instructions and useful information.</p>

<pre><code>Please describe exactly what actions triggered the bug, and the
precise symptoms of the bug.
</code></pre>

<p>Somehow I think I’ve got that one covered. I’m not sure if it’s kosher
to point them at a blog post, but all I can do is ask. If they want me
to cut-n-paste, I can resubmit, I suppose. </p>

<p>Information about running emacs in debug mode, nice to know I started
out the way that makes sense. A lot of interesting new stuff too! Ah,
pointer to the manual section on how to write an emacs bug report.
Must. Read.</p>

<p>I navigate to the Known Problems file; despite decades of using emacs
as my daily dev environment, I have never seen this before. I convert
the file to outline mode (<code>C-c C-t</code>), while I don’t find anything
remotely similar to my problem, I can’t help but laugh as I skim by
problems I’ve had with various installations of emacs. I wonder if
those were known problems at the time?</p>

<p>As I read through the entry on bug reporting, I can see how my
approach is on target as well as ways I can improve it. After a bit
of internal grumbling, I sort out a minimal path to reproduce the bug.
I stash a copy of <code>.emacs</code> and delete <code>.emacs</code>.</p>

<p>I realize that one thing I have never made explicit is that <code>M-x shell</code>
has worked perfectly all along.</p>

<p>I launch vim, lol, so I can edit this post and record every step and 
keystroke I make. Yes, emacs
is recording, too, but nothing beats making notes by hand for realizing
what you’ve missed.</p>

<p>Steps to cause the bug:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>M-x customize-apropos&lt;RET&gt;shell-switcher</code></li>
  <li>set <code>shell-switcher-new-shell-function</code> to <code>shell-switcher-make-shell</code></li>
  <li>set <code>shell-switcher-mode</code> to <code>on</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>click on <code>Apply and Save</code></p>

    <p><em>above steps create <code>.emacs</code> containing exactly</em></p>

    <p>(custom-set-variables
    ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
    ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
    ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
    ;; If there is more than one, they won’t work right.
    ‘(shell-switcher-mode t)
    ‘(shell-switcher-new-shell-function (quote shell-switcher-make-shell))
    )</p>

<pre><code>Bug Subject: customize settings not persisting across sessions +
  CHANGED outside Customize flag issue
</code></pre>

<p>Geez, I hate to use that long a subject but they really emphasize ‘just-the-facts-mam’
so I’m trying to avoid anything that comes close to guessing causes. Given that one
goes at software testing using internal fault models, that’s a really tough discipline
to follow.</p>

<p>Fill in the steps. Come back here, run generate and deploy on this post so I
can refer to it in the bug report, and submit.</p>

<p>The turn around from the emacs maintainer list was very fast. Seems it
was one bug, local to Shell Switcher, and the bug had already been
fixed in the
<a href="http://github.com/DamienCassou/shell-switcher">current version</a> on
github (last updated nine days ago, substantially after I started down
this path, lol.) The fellows who responded gave some helpful examples
of how these sorts of bugs trigger the CHANGED outside Customize flag.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that I didn’t think to check the most recent
version on github, given that it would normally be the first thing I
would check in, say, a ruby build. Humbling, that. A really good
reminder that we all have problems generalizing. </p>

<p>I also couldn’t find anyway to directly source a package from a 
github repo, akin to how one can in a Gemfile, making the current
solution not particularly scalable. Although, ah, that’s what Chef
is for. Sweet!</p>
