  abstract =      {The computing research methods (CRM) literature is scattered across discourse communities and published in specialty journals and conference proceedings. This dispersion has led to the use of inconsistent terminology when referring to CRM. With no established CRM vocabulary and isolated discourse communities, computing as a field needs to engage in a sense-making process to establish the common ground necessary to support meaningful dialog.  

We propose to establish common ground through the construction of the computing research methods multi-perspective digital library (CRM-MPDL), a scholar-produced digital resource for the CRM community. As with its parent design research project on teaching CRM, CRM-MPDL is being developed through iterative and participatory design in an emergent fashion in tandem with the larger CRM community.  

For our resource to be viable, we must carefully explore the rich details and nuances of our stakeholder communities and the perspectives they bring to the sense-making process. As a discount alternative to truly having a representative sample of our user population ``in the room'' with us throughout the design and implementation process, we have implemented a development approach for CRM-MPDL using personas as a means to gain insights and feedback from the target user communities.  

For this iteration of the development process, we are concentrating on the needs of the faculty.  

In this report, we present our evolving understanding of the project, and seek feedback and input on several key aspects of the theoretical and process models. We then present the framework for the faculty personas, as well as an overview of some of the personas at the time the paper was prepared, in the hopes that we can entice readers to visit the project website to help with the ongoing audit and refinement process. We also give an overview of the content model for CRM-MPDL, which will have evolved (and may even be available as a working prototype) by the time this article appears in print. Finally, we conclude with a current status summary, and issue several specific calls for participation in the ongoing work of the project.},

Known as ALIAS (adaptive learning image analysis system), this engine is currently being constructed and tested. ALIAS is limited to the translation and scale-invariant detection of anomalies. Future enhancements will include rotational invariance as well as the automatic classification of images. An experiment with unsupervised learning indicates excellent detection of anomalies which are square sections of the image shifted horizontally or vertically with respect to the original image. Supervised learning, to be implemented in the near future, will allow ALIAS to be conditioned to accept or reject specific anomalous features (either normal or abnormal), as appropriate}

  abstract =      {An alternative to preprogrammed rule-based Artificial Intelligence is a hierarchical network of cellular automata which acquire their knowledge through learning based on a series of trial-and-error interactions with an evaluating Environment, much as humans do. The input to the hierarchical network is provided by a set of sensors which perceive the external world. Based upon this perceived information and past experience (memory), the learning automata synthesize collections of trial responses. Periodically the automata estimate the effectiveness of these collections using either internal evaluations (unsupervised learning) or external evaluations from the Environment (supervised learning), modifying their memories accordingly. Known as Collective Learning Systems Theory, this paradigm has been applied to many sophisticated gaming problems, demonstrating robust learning and dynamic adaptivity. Based on a versatile architecture for massively parallel networks of processors for Collective Learning Systems, a Transputer-based parallel-processing image processing engine comprising 32 learning cells and 32 non-learning cells has been applied to a sophisticated image processing task: the scale-invariant and translation-invariant detection of anomalous features in otherwise ``normal'' images. In cooperation with Robert Bosch GmbH, this engine is currently being constructed and tested under the direction of the author at the Research Institute for Applied Knowledge Processing (FAW-Ulm) as Project ALIAS: Adaptive Learning Image Analysis System. Initial results indicate excellent detection, discrimination, and localization of anomalies.},

Enki makes extensive use of object-oriented structures and techniques. Well-conceived abstraction leads to objects that perform intuitively comprehensible actions. As users unfold the self-consistent structure at each level of abstraction, they are encouraged to become developers and adapt and extend the software to their needs, making progressively more complex modifications and offering them back to the community. This development process fundamentally mirrors the way we interact with the information Enki stores, transforms, and displays: as scholars navigate a library, they learn its structure, leading them to comprehend and transform the knowledge it holds at ever deeper levels. Scholars return the transformed knowledge to their community as original publications.},

Current methods are not suitable for use outside the laboratory because they interfere with normal user behavior and environment. We present a method for unobtrusively collecting subsymbolic user behavior in web-based systems, and report results from a field study. Our method is unobtrusive in that it uses current web technologies, works on the vast majority of current browsers, requires minimal instrumentation of existing web-based systems, and requires no additional user effort. This unobtrusive data collection method paves the way for future research on using subsymbolic user behavior to improve social navigation.},

In previous research, we have defined a metric for non-parametric discriminatory power called relative feature importance (RFI). In this work, we explore the construction of RFI through closed-form analysis and experimentation. The behavior of RFI is also compared to traditional techniques.}

This report is one step in a participatory design process to develop a general framework for thinking about and teaching CRM.

We introduce a novel sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That structure consists of a road map to the CRM literature, a framework grounded in questions rather than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills and specific skills. We integrate our structure with a model for the process a learner goes through on the way to becoming an expert computing researcher and offer example learning activities that represent a growing repository of course materials meant to aid those wishing to teach research skills to computing students.

Our model is designed to ground discussion of teaching CRM and to serve as a roadmap for institutions, faculty, students and research communities addressing the transition from student to fully enfranchised member of a computing research community of practice. To that end, we offer several possible scenarios for using our model.

In computing, research methods have traditionally been passed from advisor to student via apprenticeship. Establishing a richer pedagogy for training researchers in computing will benefit all (see Figure 1).},

Unobtrusive user modeling is complementary to transparent user modeling. Unobtrusive user modeling induces user models appropriate for Educational AH (EAH) based on metaphors characterized by a shared locus of control over learning, such as small group learning. Transparent user modeling, on the other hand, induces user models appropriate for EAH based on metaphors characterized by an independent locus of control, such as social navigation.
     
We extend an existing decomposition model of adaptation in AH to incorporate summative evaluation of unobtrusive user modeling. Summative evaluation examines the effects or outcomes of a system, while formative evaluation is used to improve a system under development. We also introduce a separate, two-stage model for formative evaluation of unobtrusive user modeling. We then present results from a field study for the first of the two developmental stages and describe the current field study of the second developmental stage. Finally, we compare unobtrusive and transparent user modeling, and explain the role of each.}
