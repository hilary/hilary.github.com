I've spent much of the past several weeks working on what started as
an [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) theme and turned
into its own blogging engine. This website now runs on that engine;
Octoburn.

You can read more about Octoburn on its [project
page](http://hholz.com/octoburn/). The
[code](https://github.com/hilary/octoburn) is on github, available for
use. You might want to wait until the next release, as I am currently
turning Octoburn into a gem.
